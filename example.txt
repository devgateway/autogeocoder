 In many African countries, food security and nutrition continue to be a challenge.
 To address this in Ghana, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the International
 Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) have joined forces to co-finance the Northern Rural Growth programme (NRGP).
The project was launched in 2009, to contribute to equitable and sustainable poverty reduction and food security in the
various districts in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions as well as seven adjoining districts of the Brong-Ahafo Region. Overall, the AfDB has injected USD 61.20 million in the project while the IFADï¿½s support was USD 22.73 million.
