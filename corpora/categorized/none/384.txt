It is noteworthy that in 2003, health services recorded about 81,000 cases of malaria and 4,350 cases of bloody diarrhea in the PA, caused mainly by the use of unsafe water and uncovered latrines (5.3% and 31.2% of the population respectively), both of which are health hazards because they are the source of water-borne diseases.
