The paved road network bears close to 80% of this traffic, which includes about 18-25% of the heavy goods vehicle traffic that is one of the main causes of early degradation of paved roads. Better protection of the national paved road network will soon be ensured through the setting up of weight-toll stations for which a national competitive bidding process is underway for the construction work and selection of concessionaires.
