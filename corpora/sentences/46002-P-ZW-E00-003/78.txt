To avoid fragmentation and increase impact, most of the donors support in the sector is channeled through coordinated programs such as the Zim-Fund administered by AfDB, Analytic Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF-A) managed by WB, UNICEF managed Programs (Emergency Rehabilitation and Risk Reduction Program, Small Towns Water and Sanitation Program, Rural WASH Program), and GIZ program with participation of AusAID.
