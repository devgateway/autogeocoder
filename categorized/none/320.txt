THE PROJECT  4.1 Design and Rationale of Project   4.1.1 The Tombo-Gbessia road, which underwent repairs (patching and paving of certain degraded sections) in 1995, has two types of surfaces: a flexible pavement in 2 lanes that are 7m wide, with mediocre deflections and a low quality index; and a rigid concrete pavement in two lanes that are 6.8m wide, with many cracks, unpaved shoulders and in very poor state.
