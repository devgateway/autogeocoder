To eliminate constraints to the mobilization of resources needed for road maintenance from the national budget, the Government created a second-generation Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), designed to finance maintenance of the priority road network, evaluated at 8.000 km (covering national and prefectoral roads, the primary network and farm-to-market roads), and having financial and managerial autonomy.
