Constructed around 1965, the 10.7 km long Tombo-Gbessia road, by virtue of its central position serves as both an expressway to the city center where all administrative, social and community services are located and a thoroughfare linking Conakry Port and other major commercial facilities, including the Madina international market, to the Conakry International Airport in Gbessia.
