The project will also contribute to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals through: (i) poverty and famine reduction through better supply of foodstuff and an increase in the incomes of the most vulnerable groups, particularly women; (ii) HIV/AIDS control through protection of the most exposed peoples; (iii) environmental protection through restoration of the surrounding project area; (iv) reduction of maternal and infant mortality through control of water-borne diseases and malaria (second cause of mortality in children under 5).
