Its greatest gender-related (men-women) benefits are: (i) the increased mobility of about 600.000 persons in the PA (users of transport services including women); (ii) the reduction of fuel consumption that could translate into a reduction in passenger transport fares, as a result of improved speed and a substantial reduction in congestion points; (iii) a 20% increase in the supply of transport; (iv) an improvement in health conditions for about 25,900 traders (80% of them women) in the Madina and  Bonfi markets, through the construction of eight street fountains to directly supply potable water to these markets; (v) improved access, in terms of personal comfort and safety, to employment areas (basic administrative and social services, commercial centres, etc) and centers of economic activity, notably for women from the project area and those coming from the hinterland with the resulting development of trade, opportunities and higher incomes due to increased product sales; (vi) a reduction of more than 80% in passenger transit time on the Tombo-Gbessia road (15 mn instead of the current one and a half hours).
